# wifi_scan_connect
Python project running on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W for scanning and connecting to WiFi networks

This project is the initial PoC to make sure that the USB WiFi Adapter, SSD1306 OLED display, rotary encoder can be all implemented together.

I will prepare a more detailed README.MD if it's successful...
